            <p>By design, Total solution is a highly strategic organization focused on building and bridging valued working partnerships between corporate clients and network properties that have expertise in hosting group meetings and training programs. Our success is measured by our ability to match the core values, goals and defined needs of each client to the features and benefits of select venues, generating an exceptional meeting experience.</p>
            <p>Our collaborative work goes far beyond finding the best-priced properties with the highest rating that can, for example, provide six breakouts for 30 guest rooms in peak season. Our vision is to include multiple avenues of diligence and enterprise designed to save time and money, solidify relationships, promote accountability and enhance our partners' reputation as innovators and leaders in their respective businesses.</p>
            <p>We specialize in the niche market of conference centers and hotels whose primary business is hosting professional meetings. While these venues comprise our principal network, our end goal is to find the best venue based on specific client needs and maximize the return on investment.</p>
            <p>Within the Total solution, our strength lies in the relationships we have established with general managers, sales directors and other key management roles at leading hotels, conference centers and resorts. This network embraces our point of distinction, which is the personalized introductions we make for you so your meeting venue understands who and what your organization is all about.</p>
